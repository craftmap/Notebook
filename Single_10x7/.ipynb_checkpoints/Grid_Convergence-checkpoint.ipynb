    "◦Existence/importance of separation/reattachment on smooth boundaries\n",
    "◦For integrating to the wall, 20–30 prism layers are typically used, with the near-wall y+ being of the order 1.\n",
    "◦For wall functions, 5–8 prism layers are typically used, with the near-wall y+ being of the order 50–150.\n",
    "◦When using the Spalart-Allmaras Turbulence model, integrate to the wall (do not use wall functions).\n"
