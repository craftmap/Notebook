    "    - Energy released is usually from annealing out of point defeccts and rearranging dislocations\n",
    "    - Electrical resistivitiy drops\n",
    "    - SUMMARY: In recovery there is a large decrease in the number of point defects as they diffuse to edge dislocations and grain boundaries. Dislocations rearrange themselves into lower energy configurations leading to the formation of subgrains. Enough creep occurs to reduce elastic strains. There are major changes in electrical properties, some softening, and a reduction of residual stresses, but no changes of microstructure.\"\n",

    "- Recrystallization\n",
    "    - Cold-worked grains with high dislocation deinsity are replaced by new grains with much lower dis. en.\n",
    "    - T_recrystallization: Temp at which 50% of sample recrystalizes in 30 minutes\n",
    "    - More cold work and also smaller grains lead to lower T_recry\n",
    "    - More cold work increases both nucleation rate and growth rate which decreases grain sizes formed by recry.\n",
    "    - Impurities slow grwth rate which leads to more nucleation and recry graims are therefore smaller\n",
    "    - ?? True or False (as books says?)\n",

    "        2) Dihedral angles between three grain boundaries average 120deg\n",
    "    - Large grains are concave in and grow out\n",
    "        - Small grains are convex and are eaten by big ones\n",
