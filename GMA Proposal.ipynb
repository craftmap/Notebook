    "# Outline of Proposal\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "- Recent advances in electric aircraft technologies has led to significant changes in the design possiblities of next generation vehicles. \n",
    "- Vertical take of and landing (VTOL) vehicles are one design that has been made possible by the advancement of these electric technologies.\n",
    "- Distributed electric propulsion introduces inter-propeller aerodynamic and aeroacoustical interactions that can decrease efficiency and increse noise.\n",
    "    - Efficiency is of key importance as battery technologies are still limited and efficiency directly effects key perfomance metrics of aircraft, like range.\n",
    "    - With several next generation electric aircraft being designed for use in urban settings, noise is of key imporance.\n",
    "- Current methods that can be used to study these interactions–namely high fidelity computational fluid dynamic and empirical testing–are very computationally prohibitive for conceptual design. \n",
    "- Our aim is to create a mid-fidelity tool for use in studying these interactions and to publish high quality emperical data that can be used in validation of this tool and of other similar tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Student Involvement/Research\n",
    "- The unique design of this research project has already allowed for great mentoring of junior ME student Lindsay Lawless, who over the last semester has been able to gain significant hands on experience with the new byu windtunnel and other department resources reserved exclusively for research.\n",
    "- Due to the quick learning and impressive results Lindsay has already produced the current plan is to have her oversee and supervise the mentoring of a new sophore student, Richard Tainter, who is joining the project next semester.\n",
    "    - She has already participated and helped in the project plan for the upcoming semester and specifically laying out the goals and roles Richard will fill. \n",
    "    - Both undergraduates will still continue to be mentored and meet regularly with Austin Schenk who is the MS student over the project who will recieve any extra help from Eduardo Alvarez(PhD) or Dr Ning who are respectiviely the PhD student and PI over the project.  \n",
    "- On this project Lindsay and Richard will be able to apply many of the core fundamentals that are taught in classes to a real world project. Fundmentals such as experimental design, research paper construction, and experimental documentation will be solidified through hands on experience. \n",
    "- Results will be measured in weekly meetings with Austin, weekly presentations/discussion in front of the entire lab, as well as documentation in a required lab notebook. \n",
    "- Currently with this area of research being new and cutting-edge there is not currently an established pattern of funding. \n",
    "    - Much of the intrest in this area has mainly been by start-up companies, with larger companies just begining to show an interest. \n",
    "    - Electric aircraft has historically been considered a novelty that was only pursued by start-ups and since there has only recently been interest shown by large companies, due to the electric propulsion advancements, there is not an established funding pattern yet. \n",
    "    - As such, this funding will help facilitate Austin, Lindsay, and Richard to become key-players in a nascent industry. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcomes\n",
    "- The mentoring of a junior and sophore student  who are both interested in pursueing graduate degrees. \n",
    "- Hands on experience with principles taught in class and experience with state-of-the-art wind tunnel.\n",
    "- One major outcome of this research will be validation which will be published and directly used in our lab for the  validation of Austin's computer simulations and for validating Eduardo Alvarez's Vortex Particle Model. \n",
    "- Due to the significant contributions already made by Lindsay and her plans of continued involvement with the project she will have the opportunity to write part of a journal paper and be a co-author with Austin on his jornal paper which will include parts of these empirical test. \n",
    "- A rare opportunity for a junior to co-mentor a sophmore student who is just begining with research. \n",
    "- As a requirment in the lab all three students involved will be required to submitt a journal quality end of semester report, documenting and commenting on thier research, which will go through multiple peer reviews and a final evaluation by Dr. Ning. This allows student to learn how to consolidate months worth of work into a concise and clear verbal presentation of their results.\n",
    "- Initial exposure to reserach for two motivated undergraduates that both have expressed a desire and plan to pursueing higher education after graduation. \n",
    "- Both Lindsay and Richard plan on attending the Utah Conference on Undergraduate Research to present their results.\n"
